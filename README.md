# Meshtasticator
Discrete-event simulator for layers 0-3 of [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/), to understand its working and assess the scalability of the protocol.

The source code is based on [this repo](https://github.com/lucagioacchini/lora-network-simulator), which eventually stems from [1].

## Synopsis
```./loraMesh.py [nr_nodes] [--from-file <file_name>]``` 

This runs one simulation, after which it plots the placement of nodes and time schedule for each set of overlapping messages.

If no additional argument is given, you first have to place the nodes on a plot. 
If the number of nodes is given, it will randomly place nodes in the area. It makes sure that each node can reach at least one other node. Furthermore, all nodes are placed at a configurable minimum distance (MINDIST) from each other. 
If you use the argument --from-file <file_name>, it reads the location of nodes from a file in */out/coords*. Do not specify the number of nodes in this case.

```./batchSim.py``` 

This runs multiple repetitions of simulations for a set of parameters defined in the script, e.g. the number of nodes. Afterwards, it plots relevant metrics obtained from the simulations. It saves these metrics in */out/report/* to analyze them later on.

For example, these are the results of 100 simulations of 200s with a different hop limit and number of nodes. As expected, the average number of nodes reached for each generated message increases as the hop limit increases.

However, it comes at the cost of usefulness, i.e., the amount of received packets that contain a new message (not a duplicate due to rebroadcasting) out of all packets received.

## Configurations
There are some other configurations that can be set in */lib/config.py*, some of which are listed below.

### Modem
The LoRa modem that is used, as defined below:
|Modem  | Name | Bandwidth (kHz) | Coding rate | Spreading Factor
|--|--|--|--|--|
| 0 |Short Fast|250|8|7
| 1 |Short Slow|250|8|8
| 2 |Mid Fast|250|8|9
| 3 |Mid Slow|250|8|10
| 4 |Long Fast|250|8|11
| 5 |Long Slow|125|8|12
| 6 |Very Long Slow|31.25|8|12

### Model
This feature is referred to the path loss model. The implemented pathloss models are:
* ```0``` set the log-distance model  
* ```1``` set the Okumura-Hata for small and medium-size cities model  
* ```2``` set the Okumura-Hata for metropolitan areas  
* ```3``` set the Okumura-Hata for suburban enviroments  
* ```4``` set the Okumura-Hata for rural areas  
* ```5``` set the 3GPP for suburban macro-cell  
* ```6``` set the 3GPP for metropolitan macro-cell  
* ```7``` set the Polynomial 3rd degree 
* ```8``` set the Polynomial 6th degree 

### Period
Mean period (in ms) with which the nodes generate a new message following an exponential distribution. 

### Interference level 
Chance that at a given moment there is already a LoRa packet being sent on your channel, outside of the Meshtastic traffic. Given in a ratio from 0 to 1.
