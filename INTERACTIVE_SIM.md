# Interactive simulator

The Python script *interactiveSim.py* uses the [Linux native application of Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/docs/software/linux-native) in order to simulate multiple instances of the device software. They will communicate using TCP via this script as if they did using their LoRa chip. The simulator will forward a message from the sender to all nodes that can hear it, based on their simulated positions and the pathloss model used (see [Pathloss model](#Pathloss-model)). Collisions of packets are not (yet) simulated.  

## Usage
Please `git clone` or download this repository, navigate to the Meshtasticator folder (optionally create a virtual environment) and install the necessary requirements using: 
```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

The simulator runs the Linux native application of Meshtastic firmware, which can be done on your Linux PC using [PlatformIO](https://meshtastic.org/docs/development/firmware/build) or using [Docker](https://meshtastic.org/docs/software/linux-native#usage-with-docker). 
- Using PlatformIO, select 'native' and click on 'build'. Locate the generated binary file, which will probably be in *Meshtastic-device/.pio/build/native/*. Either copy the file called 'program' to the directory where you will be running the Python script from, or add the full path as argument after *--p*. For example: ```python3 interactiveSim.py 3 --p /home/User/Meshtastic-device/.pio/build/native/```.
- For usage with Docker, the simulator will pull a Container Image from Docker Hub, which builds the latest Meshtastic firmware. Install the Docker SDK for Python with ```pip3 install docker```. Make sure the Docker daemon or Desktop application is running. Then run the interactive simulator with *--d* as argument, e.g.: ```python3 interactiveSim.py 3 --d```.

The interactive simulator can then be run as follows: 

```python3 interactiveSim.py [nrNodes] [--p <full-path-to-program>]```,

where *nrNodes* (optional) is the number of instances you want to launch. Note that for each instance a terminal and TCP port (starting at 4403) is opened. If the number of nodes is given, they will be randomly placed, otherwise you first have to place the nodes on a plot. After you place a node, you can change its [role](https://meshtastic.org/docs/settings/config/device#role), hopLimit, height (elevation) and antenna gain. These settings will automatically save when you place a new node or when you start the simulation.

When the simulation is started, you can send [commands](#list-of-commands) to let the nodes send messages (or use a [script](#usage-with-script)). Once the nodes are done sending, you can plot the routes of the messages and airtime statistics by entering 'plot'. Then you will see a plot where you can enter a message ID to show its route. Hover over an arc to see some information and click to remove the information afterwards. Hovering is sometimes a bit laggy, so you might have to hover over it multiple times. It will also plot two graphs showing the channel utilization (recorded with a one-minute window) and transmitting airtime utilization (hourly window) for every node.

## List of commands
- ```broadcast <fromNode> <txt>```  
  Send a broadcast from node *fromNode* with text *txt*.
- ```DM <fromNode> <toNode> <txt>```  
  Send a Direct Message from node *fromNode* to node *toNode* with text *txt*.
- ```traceroute <fromNode> <toNode>```  
  Send a traceroute request from node *fromNode* to node *toNode*.
- ```reqPos <fromNode> <toNode>``` 

  Send a position request from node *fromNode* to node *toNode*.
- ```ping <fromNode> <toNode>```

  Send ping from node *fromNode* to node *toNode*.
- ```nodes <id0> [id1, etc.]```

  Show the node list as seen by node(s) *id0*, *id1*, etc.
- ```plot```

  Plot the routes of messages sent and airtime statistics.
- ```exit``` 

  Exit the simulator without plotting routes.

## Usage with script
To predefine what you want to send, you can also modify the script *interactiveSim.py* in the 'try' clause. Then you will have to run the simulator with the '--s' argument, like: ```python3 interactiveSim.py 3 --s```.
The nodes first exchange their NodeInfo. Afterwards, you can let them send messages. Once the nodes are done sending, you can close them by pressing Control+c or just wait for the timeout set at the end of the 'try' clause. 

## Tips and tricks
1. Depending on the number of nodes, exchanging the NodeInfo might take quite some time. You can also disable these by removing ```new NodeInfoModule()``` (and other modules) in *src/modules/Modules.cpp* in the device firmware. This works because the simulator already knows the NodeIDs. 

2. If you placed the nodes yourself, after a simulation the number of nodes, their coordinates and configuration are automatically saved and you can rerun the scenario with: 

  ```python3 interactiveSim.py --from-file```

  If you want to change any of the configurations, adapt the file *out/nodeConfig.yaml* before running it with the above command.

3. The simulator can essentially do the same configurations as the Python CLI. If you use ```sim.getNodeById(<id>)``` in *interactiveSim.py*, you can call a function in the Node class of the CLI, e.g. ```.setURL(<'YOUR_URL'>)```.

## Pathloss model
The simulator uses a pathloss model to calculate how well a signal will propagate. Note that this is only a rough estimation of the physical environment and will not be 100% accurate, as it depends on a lot of factors. The implemented pathloss models are:
* ```0``` set the log-distance model  
* ```1``` set the Okumura-Hata for small and medium-size cities model  
* ```2``` set the Okumura-Hata for metropolitan areas  
* ```3``` set the Okumura-Hata for suburban enviroments  
* ```4``` set the Okumura-Hata for rural areas  
* ```5``` set the 3GPP for suburban macro-cell  
* ```6``` set the 3GPP for metropolitan macro-cell  

You can change the pathloss model and the area to simulate in */lib/config.py*. 
Currently the LoRa settings are kept to the default of Meshtastic, except those you configure when placing the nodes on a plot.
